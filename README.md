# Face Recognition with DeepFace

## Description
This project demonstrates real-time face recognition using a custom dataset.  
It uses Haar Cascade for face detection and DeepFace for face recognition.

## Features
- Create a dataset using webcam  
- Detect faces using OpenCV Haar Cascade  
- Recognize faces using DeepFace models  
- Supports multiple recognition backends and distance metrics

## Installation
Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python deepface matplotlib
